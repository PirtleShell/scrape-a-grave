>  Scrape and Retrieve [FindAGrave](http://findagrave.com) memorial page data and save them to an SQL database.


## Scraping
[FindAGrave](http://findagrave.com) is an index of gravemarkers from cemeteries around the world. Often when doing genealogy research, you don't want to rely on a webpage's future and so you want to download the information to your local file. This python script takes a list of Grave Marker numbers, or FindAGrave urls, scrapes the site for data and prints out a citation of the information. It is currently setup to also save the data in an SQL database.


## Usage
Download these files and change the contents of input text to be a list of FindAGrave ids, or FindAGrave urls. Then run
```sh
$ python3 getgraveids.py
```

The citations will be printed to the console and saved in an SQL database named `graves.db`.
